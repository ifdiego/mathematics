# Mathematics

This repository contains a lot of snippets of code and experiments simulating mathematics and physics formulas.

## Why mathematics
For such a long time I've been a mathematics fan.
It was my favorite subject back in school.
And even today I'm still curious about it.
In my free time, I keep studying it.

## Why Lisp?
Since I'm also curious about programming I decided to implement all this experiments in a language which I never used and got curious about Lisp because of the programming style that I've never seen before.

## How to run
To run any example you'll need SBCL installed.

And then just run:

```
sbcl --script example.lisp
```

Enjoy.
