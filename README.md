# Mathematics

This repository contains a lot of snippets of codes and experiments simulating mathematics and physics.

## Mathematics?
I'm really interested in mathematics and I've been an enthusiast for such a long time. It was my favourite subject back in school and I'm still cuious about it. Always I found some time I try to read/study something about it.

## Lisp?
I'm also interested in programming languagens and got curious about Functional Programming and Common Lisp, so I took the oportunity to implement these experiments in this language.

## Running an example
First of all you'll need [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org) or another Common Lisp interpreter.

After installed, you can running it by:
```
sbcl --script example.lisp
```
