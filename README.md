This repository contains a lot of snippets of codes and experiments simulating mathematics and physics.

## Mathematics
I'm really interested in mathematics and I've been an enthusiast for such a long time. It was my favourite subject back in school and I'm still curious about it. Always I found some time I try to read/study something related.

## Clojure
I'm also interested in programming languagens and got curious about Functional Programming and Clojure, so I took the oportunity to implement these experiments in this language.
