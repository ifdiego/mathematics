# Mathematics

This repository contains a lot of snippets of code and experiments simulating mathematics and physics formulas.

## Why mathematics
For such a long time I've been a mathematics enthusiast.  
It was my favorite subject back in school.  
And I'm still curious about it.  
In my free time, if possible, I try to study a little bit.

## Why Lisp?
Since I'm also curious about programming languages, I decided to implement some mathematics experiments in a language I've never seen before.  
I got interested in Functional Programming and took the oportunity to use Common Lisp in this project.

## How to run
To run any example you'll need SBCL installed.

And then just run:

```
sbcl --script example.lisp
```

Enjoy.
